"""Compare two snapshots of the same app ("what did my action change?").

When both snapshots carry session refs from the same counter (see
:mod:`axpilot.perception.refs`), elements with the **same ref** are paired first: refs are
carried from snapshot to snapshot, so an equal ref means the same element. The remaining
elements are matched in passes, strongest evidence first; each element is matched at most once:

1. same ``AXIdentifier`` (and AX role);
2. same locator path *and* same name;
3. same AX role, name and frame (rounded to whole points);
4. same AX role and name, when that pair is unique among the unmatched elements on both sides
   (handles elements that moved because something was inserted above them);
5. same locator path alone, when the frames overlap (a label whose text changed, or a
   Play button that became Pause). With shared refs this pass only pairs *unnamed*
   elements: ref carrying already kept the ref of a named element that is still there (a
   renamed button keeps its engine handle), so a named element with another ref at the same
   place is another element (a list row that now shows other content), never a rename.

Unmatched elements of ``after`` are *added*, unmatched elements of ``before`` are *removed*,
and matched pairs whose name, value or state differ are *changed*. When the app or window
differs between the snapshots nothing is matched: every element of ``after`` is new to the
agent, and pairing look-alike controls of two different windows would only mislead it.

The passes run on the matching engine shared with ref carrying
(:class:`~axpilot.perception.refs.ElementMatcher`).
